# Roadmap and standing intent

This file is the working brief for anyone, human or agent, picking up the next piece of the game. It sits beside the
original engineering brief and records what the owner has decided since. **Decisions here override the original brief
where they conflict.**

## Owner's standing intent (in their words, paraphrased where needed)

- Art: grimdark hand-painted concept illustration. "Less cartoonish", "not AI-looking", "League-style splash quality",
  "more grunge". Round 4 in `art/samples` is the approved bar. Never credit any AI tool in repo content.
- Maps are never even squares or cookie-cutter. Real battlefields are uneven: trenches, mud, mountains, valleys, rivers.
  Playable areas are odd shapes.
- Three universal win conditions: wipe out the opponent, kill their army leader, or force a surrender. Scenario
  objectives sit on top of these.
- Every faction gets rank ladders with mechanical weight. Samurai (19 ranks) and Shinobi (6, each with a movement
  trait; Shinobi outrun Knights through forest) are in. Knight, Dragon Host and Ritual Cult ladders are next.
- Every faction gets cannons (siege) and cavalry that fit its theme. Four of each exist with art.
- Ritual and Fusion are first-class functions of the engine.
- Samples first. Show the owner a sample of any new visual direction before scaling it.
- Maps are painted **straight down from above**, like a hand-painted satellite photograph, with readable regions,
  roads and rooftops. The three-quarter battlefield paintings were rejected. A Samurai province with a Japanese
  aesthetic is the reference region.
- The army is a **100-card deck** plus a **20-card ritual/fusion side deck**. Cards carry 1 to 10 stars; 10 is
  reserved for deities, gods, Kage, shoguns and kings, 1 for levy and squires. Higher units demand sacrifices,
  as in the collectible card games the owner named.
- Beyond match-to-match battles there is a **permanent holding**: base building, research that upgrades units,
  and recruitment draws.
- Every asset must sit beside the existing characters without breaking immersion. Interface and icons included.
- Battlefields must be large enough that units sit comfortably and the camera zooms in; a unit must never scale a
  mountain instantly. Mountains slow ground movement fivefold; only fliers ignore them.
- Cards are **paper**, never metal, and nothing in the interface may carry punched holes or rows of dots.
- The stronghold's buildings and walls are upgradable and change their look as they rise, which means a growing
  asset list that has to be tracked.

## Status

The done list, the priority queue and what is blocked on an owner decision now live in `docs/CHECKLIST.md`,
which is what each implementation pass reads and claims from. Keeping that accounting in one file stops this
one from drifting out of sync with it, as its own "Done" and "Next" sections once did. This file stays the
place for the owner's standing intent, above, and the brainstorm log, below.

## Brainstorm log

Append dated notes here. Ideas are proposals until the owner approves them.

- 2026-09-05: Weather as a round modifier (rain turns Open to Mud along rivers, fog reduces ranged range by 1).
- 2026-09-05: Siege pieces could target hexes for suppressive fire, laying a temporary "Shelled" terrain (−50 DEF,
  breaks charges) for one round.
- 2026-09-05: Shinobi Kage as an Army-tier unique with a once-per-battle "Night Falls" that hides every Shinobi in
  forest for one round.
- 2026-09-05: Proposal — a Samurai province campaign map where each region is a scenario, won regions feed the
  holding's resource production, and losing a region costs the buildings raised there.
- 2026-09-05: Proposal — duplicate cards from recruitment could feed a "reforge" that raises a card's star by
  one, giving duplicates a purpose instead of dead weight.
- 2026-09-05: Proposal — the side deck could hold a third card kind, a Stratagem, played from the side deck for a
  one-round battlefield effect (a forced march, a smokescreen, a false retreat), keeping the twenty-card cap.
- 2026-09-05: Fusion charges as a scenario resource: defenders start with 2, attackers 1, to make late fusions a comeback tool.
- 2026-09-06: Proposal — tie some ritual and fusion recipes to the terrain the irregular map generator already
  lays down, instead of leaving them terrain-blind. A Ritual Cult sovereign invocation could require its circle
  stand on Ruins, a Dragon Host fusion could require High Ground, a Knight fusion could require a Fortification.
  Every battlefield is generated fresh and odd-shaped, so this would not be a fixed puzzle; it would give
  commanders a reason to fight for a specific hex beyond a flat defence bonus, and it would put the map
  generator's variety to work in the one system that currently ignores it.
